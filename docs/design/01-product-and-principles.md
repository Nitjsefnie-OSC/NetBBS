# NetBBS design — §1. Product identity, terminology, and principles

Part of the [NetBBS design](../NetBBS-design-doc.md). Section numbers are stable: cite this area's rules by their section numbers (§1.n).

## 1. Product identity, terminology, and principles

### 1.1 Names

- **NetBBS** is the software project.
- **NetBBS Link** is the decentralized network connecting NetBBS nodes. “The
  Link” is acceptable informal shorthand.
- **Board** always means a message board.
- **Area** always means a file area. Never call a file area a board.
- **Link** prefixes features which exist specifically because of NetBBS Link:
  **Link message**, **Link Community**, **Link-wide** presence or chat.
- An ordinary local resource which participates in NetBBS Link keeps its normal
  noun with the adjective **linked**: linked board, linked channel, linked file
  area. Do not rename such resources into “Link boards” or similar proper
  nouns.

### 1.2 Foundational principles

NetBBS Link is foundational, not an add-on. Every durable local feature should
be designed with its possible network extension in mind, even when the local
version ships first.

The standalone BBS must remain complete and useful without NetBBS Link. Local
packages must not import Phase-3 federation code merely to perform ordinary
local work.

Node sovereignty is non-negotiable:

- no master node exists;
- no node, moderator, or majority vote can force another operator to store,
  display, or delete content;
- carrying remote content is always a local decision;
- moderation and trust signals may propagate, but enforcement remains local;
- remote closure or suppression events cannot remotely erase bytes already
  stored by another node.

The design prefers correctness, explicit authority, bounded resource use, and
visible failure over cleverness or silent degradation.

### 1.3 Non-goals

NetBBS is not intended to:

- recreate a centralized social network behind a terminal interface;
- promise anonymity from a user’s own home-node operator for ordinary
  password-only accounts;
- make every local feature network-wide immediately;
- replicate every file byte to every node;
- hide unresolved trust decisions behind signature verification alone;
- preserve historical BBS protocol constraints when they conflict with the
  native NetBBS model.
